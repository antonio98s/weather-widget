I created a weather widget using Node.js, Express.js, and the OpenWeather API. The user can enter a city on the search entry, click on the "Get Weather" button, and the temperature of the city will be displayed. For example, the user can type in the city, Boston, and the temperature in Fahrenheit will be shown. Once the city has been entered and the temperature has been displayed, the user is free to change the location using the search bar. I used the OpenWeatherAPI in order to provide the user the temperature of the given city. In addition, I used Express.js web framework in order to create the server environment for the widget. The project, overall, took about 1 hour to complete. If I were to create a second version of this widget, I would include not only the temperature, but also the forecast (sunny, cloudy, rain, snow, etc) as well as other features such as humidity levels. I would also style the widget so it is eye-catching and user friendly. The reason I did not style this version is to demonstrate the logic of the task, which involves implementing the OpenWeather API.
